If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the application.\n\n2. Description of Service\nPass is a local-first password manager that encrypts your data using your master password. Your passwords are stored encrypted on your device.\n\n3. User Responsibilities\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your master password and recovery key. We cannot recover your data if you lose access to both.\n\n4. Data Ownership\nAll data stored in Pass belongs to you. We do not access, read, or process your encrypted data.\n\n5. Limitation of Liability\nPass is provided \"as is\" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any data loss resulting from software bugs, user error, or device failure.\n\n6. Changes to Terms\nWe reserve the right to update these terms. Continued use of the application constitutes acceptance of updated terms.",
    privacyContent: "Privacy Policy\n\nLast updated: February 2026\n\n1. Data Collection\nPass collects minimal data: your email address for account identification and an encrypted password hash for authentication. Your vault data is encrypted locally and never transmitted in readable form.\n\n2. Local Storage\nYour passwords and sensitive data are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using keys derived from your master password via Argon2. The encryption keys never leave your device.\n\n3. Cloud Sync (Optional)\nIf you enable cloud sync, your vault data is transmitted to our servers in encrypted form. We cannot decrypt your data. Only you hold the keys.\n\n4. No Tracking\nPass does not use analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind. We do not collect usage data.\n\n5. Third-Party Services\nPass uses MongoDB for optional cloud sync and account management. No other third-party services receive your data.\n\n6. Data Deletion\nYou can delete your account and all associated data at any time. Local data is removed by uninstalling the application.\n\n7.
